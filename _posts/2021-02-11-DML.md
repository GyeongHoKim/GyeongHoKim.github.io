# SELECT command

base way how to use SELECT command is,

``` sql
SELECT <field name>, <field name>, ..., FROM <table name>;
```

Like this, finding records by selecting certain field, we call it **Projection**.
Then, how to find records of all of columns? We can use \*.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM <table name>
```

## eleminate duplicate entry

use `DISTINCT` keyword.

``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT <field name> FROM <table name>
```

## calculated field

when you use `SELECT`, you can project new column by entering certain mathematical expression even though there are not the column in the table. When you do this, vertual table named **DUAL** stores those columns you made.

``` sql
SELECT (5*10) + 2 FROM DUAL;
SELECT (5*10) + 2;// FROM DUAL is default
```

## alias

you can temporarily change columns name when you show records by `SELECT`. You just need to add `AS` keyword.

``` sql
SELECT <field name> <field name>*10 AS <new name> FROM <table name>;
```

## sort

you can temporarily sort records by `ORDER BY` keyword.

``` sql
SELECT <field name> FROM <table name> ORDER BY <field name you want to sort> <DESC or ASC>;
```

## limit

when you print records, you can limit the amount of data by `LIMIT` keyword.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM <table name> LIMIT <number>;
```

## filtering

you can add conditions at `WHERE` phrase.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM <table name> WHERE <conditions ex: id=155>;
```

### IS, IN, BETWEEN...AND, LIKE

those operators are frequently used.

1. `IS`
	* compare with `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `UNKNOWN`.
2. `IN`
	* compare with set of values in (). cannot compare NULL or set which is mixed with strings and numbers.
3. `BETWEEN <min> AND <max>`
	* extract records which satisfies certain range
4. `LIKE`
	* extract records with wild card(% responding to every string or _ responding to one single string)

The End.
