# Cain Calendar

**문제**

It was recently revealed by the ICPC excavation team that the Inca Empire was established just after the Cain Empire which was a splendid civilization that flourished in South America. It is believed that the people in the Cain Empire used an interesting odd calendar. In their calendar, a year was represented by <x:y>, where x and y are natural numbers which are less than or equal to M and N, respectively. The first year, that is, the beginning of the world is represented by <1:1>. The second year is represented by <2:2>. Let <x':y'>be the following year of <x:y>. If x < M, x' = x + 1, otherwise x' = 1. Similarly, if y < N, y' = y + 1, otherwise y' = 1. The last year of their calendar is <M:N>. It is said that there was a prophecy which states the world ends in the year <M:N>. 

For example, assume that M = 10 and N = 12. The first year is represented by <1:1>. The year <1:11> represents the 11th year, <3:1> represents the 13th year, and <10:12> represents the 60th year which is the last year. 

Given four integers M, N, x, and y, write a program that computes the number k such that <x:y> represents the kth year, where <x:y> is the last year of the world in the Cain Calendar.

**입력**

Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case consists of a single line containing four integers M, N, x, and y (1 ≤ M,N ≤ 40 000, 1 ≤ x ≤ M, 1 ≤ y ≤ N), where <M:N> is the last year of the world in the Cain Calendar.

**출력**

Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. The line should contain an integer k, where the kth year is represented by <x:y> for x and y given in the input. If there doesn’t exist a year represented by <x:y>, print -1.

# 풀이

싹 다 돌면 시간초과 뜬다. 어차피 나머지만 이용하면 일정 수가 돌아오는 주기가 일정하니 건너뛰면서 순회하면 된다.

``` c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int LCM(int M, int N)
{
		int mul = M * N;
			while(N > 0) {
						int tmp = N;
								N = M % N;
										M = tmp;
											}
				return mul / M;
}

// 인덱스 구하는 루프문 하나 구하고 인덱스 구한 다음에는 M씩 점프. 그 점프하는 루프에서 y가 나머지로 나오거나 나누어떨어지는 경우를 찾으면 됨

int solution(int M, int N, int x, int y)
{
		int total = LCM(M, N);
			int index;
				
				for(index = 1; index <= total; ++index)
							if((index - 1) % M + 1 == x) break;
					
					for(int i = index; i <= total; i+= M)
								if((i - 1) % N + 1 == y) return  i;
						
						return -1;
}

int main()
{
		int C, M, N, x, y;
			cin >> C;

				while(C--) {
							cin >> M >> N >> x >> y;
									cout << solution(M, N, x, y) << endl;
										}

					return 0;
}
```
